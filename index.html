                            <p class="aboutp allotherfont">My name is Ivan Saucedo. I'm 29 years old. Originally from El Paso, Texas, I currently live in Austin. I was first exposed to programming in high school. My best friend had started playing around with tutorials and I followed suit. I picked up basic HTML and Python, all culminating in a class project we both worked on. Unfortunately, I left it all on the back burner as I chased other creative outlets, namely music and writing. A couple years ago, I caught a YouTube video of a 12-year old giving a presentation about an iOS app he had created. This rekindled my interest and I began trying to learn on my own. I enrolled in edX's Intro to Computer Science, as well as several web development courses on Udemy, Udacity, and Codeacademy. Of course, I also followed programming channels on online message boards and, most recently, I began reading Eloquent Javascript, as suggested by the internet.

                            <p class="aboutp allotherfont">I was exposed to a lot of new concepts and I became familiar with these concepts, but unfortunately I was missing a sense of structure, direction, and teamwork. I wanted to take my programming career beyond baby steps. In November of 2017, I stumbled onto the UT Coding Bootcamp and, after researching the program and consulting with a friend who is in the industry, I decided to take the plunge. This particular friend works in web development and I look up to him. I admire what he's doing and I want to do the same for others. I want to set a good example and be a role model for my niece and nephews.
                            </p>
                            <p class="aboutp allotherfont">I'm excited to be here. I'm excited to be learning from talented individuals. And most importantly, I'm excited about meeting and working with like-minded people.
